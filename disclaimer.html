                  When you place an order, we will request certain details so that we
                  may process your order quickly and efficiently. In addition to your
                  name, address, email address, and phone number, we will also need
                  your payment information, such as a credit card or debit card
                  number.
                  <br /><br />
                  The only required information to place an order is your name,
                  address, email address, phone number, and payment information. All
                  information that is provided is the sole ownership of IronXMale and
                  will not be sold or distributed. We reserve the right, at our sole
                  discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. IronXMale
                  reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to limit the quantity of
                  items purchased per person, per household or per order. These
                  restrictions may be applicable to orders placed by the same account
                  or the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same
                  billing and/or shipping address. We will provide notification to the
                  customer should such limits be applied.
                  <br /><br />
                  Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled
                  include limitations on quantities available for purchase,
                  inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information or problems
                  identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also
                  require additional verifications or information before accepting any
                  order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is
                  cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your
                  order. If your order is cancelled after your credit card has been
                  charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card in the amount of
                  the charge.

                  9. Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent, we

                  request and its impact on our relationship with you) for your
                  request to be processed and for us to notify you of the consequences
                  of us acceding to the same, including any legal consequences which
                  may affect your rights and liabilities to us. In general, we shall
                  seek to process your request within ten (10) business days of
                  receiving it.
                  <br /><br />
                  10. Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please
                  note that depending on the nature and scope of your request, we may
                  not be in a position to continue providing our goods or services to
                  you and we shall, in such circumstances, notify you before
                  completing the processing of your request. Should you decide to
                  cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing in
                  the manner described in clause 8 above.
                  <br /><br />
                  11. Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right
                  to continue to collect, use and disclose personal data where such
                  collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted or
